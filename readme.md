Project: Data Fetching and Sorting by Department and Salary

In this project, I built a web application that fetches data from a server using the Fetch API. The fetched data is processed and displayed dynamically on the UI. I implemented sorting functionality that organizes the data based on the department and salary of employees. The key technologies used in this project include:

Fetch API: Used to retrieve data from the server asynchronously.
Sorting Algorithm: Created a sorting function to order the data by department and salary.
JavaScript: Employed for manipulating the data and controlling the flow of the application.
HTML/CSS: Designed and styled the UI for a clean and responsive user experience.
